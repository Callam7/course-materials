# IN628 2019 Practical 11.2 - Intro to Python

'''
In this practical, you will complete a number of small exercises designed to familiarise 
you with some of the elements of Python syntax that differ markedly from that of the 
C-family languages.
'''

'''
1.	Create a variable with string value “0123456789”. Use the slice operator to solve the 
following problems, trying to make your solutions as succinct as possible (this is “idiomatic Python”). 
All of these can be solved with a single slice operation – no for-loops or other complex flow of 
control is required.

    a.	Write two different expressions to produce 4567
    b.	Produce 56789
    c.	Produce 1357
    d.	Produce 7531

2.	Python provides many powerful operations for sequence types. Use a reputable Python reference 
(textbook or educational site) to research each of the operations listed below. Then, write a simple 
code example to demonstrate clearly the functionality of each operation. We will look at some of your 
solutions in class.

    a.	in
    b.	not in 
    c.	concatenation (the + operator)
    d.	repetition (the * operator)
    e.	len
    f.	min & max
    g.	index
    h.	count
    i.	del 
    j.	append
    k.	extend
    l.	insert
    m.	remove
    n.	pop
    o.	reverse

3.	Consider the class Cat shown in the lecture PowerPoint. You wish to modify the class so that you 
can efficiently keep track of the number of Cats that are created in your program. Add an appropriate 
variable to the class, and an appropriate line of code to the constructor so that, when the following 
statements are executed,

fido = Cat('fido', 'Persian')
buddy = Cat('buddy', 'Siamese')
spot = Cat('spot', 'Ragdoll')

The output is
3
3
3

What is the output when you execute print(catCount) after creating the three Cat instances? Explain, 
using correct technical terminology, why this has occurred. You can include your explanation in your 
code as a comment.
